# Hanoi-Viewer
Hanoï Viewer is a script made in Python using Pygame to see how to solve the Hanoï towers. It feature an autmoatic player and a step by step system to see how to move the rings.

If you don't know what's the Hanoï towers, here is a small explanation.

The goal is to move all the rings from the left to the right, but you can only move rings one by one
and you can't place a ring onto a smaller one !

In order to make the programm working, you'll need to have pygame library installed, if you don't have it, just run your cmd and enter 'pip install pygame"
